Two main components:
Native App
	Starts/Stops Service manually with input from user
	Uploads immediately with input from user

Native Service
	Maintains Timer based readings
	Two Timers are maintained: Data Read Starting Interval(60s) & Data Recording Interval(15s)
	"Data Read Starting Interval" is started on launching of service and runs infinitely
	"Data Recording Interval" is started at the time of starting of sensors reading and paused on stopping of sensors.
	
	So, Sensor values are recorded at first 15s of every 60s from the time service has started.
	
	File Uploading is done via polling when the sensors recording is just paused(i.e. on 15th second).
	If uploading is succeeded the uploaded files are deleted.

	Each recording i.e. 15s has separate csv files named after starting TIMESTAMP of that recording.return

	Activity recognition from tizen manual did not work.
